Guidance
We provided guidance on February 2, 2023, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These
forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2023, and are subject to substantial
uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty
regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and
geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates,
regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce,
and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”
First Quarter 2023 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $121.0 billion and $126.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 8% compared
with first quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from
foreign exchange rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the
market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth
below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our
long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements.
However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of
interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.
We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term
fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest
rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in
interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities,
including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2022 (in
millions, except percentages):

As of December 31, 2022, we had long-term debt with a face value of $70.5 billion, including the current portion,
primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
— Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.
31
Foreign Exchange Risk
During 2022, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and
related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in
our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily
include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances
associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon
consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and
we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net
sales decreased by $15.0 billion in comparison with the prior year.
We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign
funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2022, of $18.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20%
adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $915 million, $1.8 billion, and $3.7 billion.
We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies.
Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2022, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign
exchange rates would result in losses of $275 million, $555 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense),
net.”
See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of
changes in foreign exchange rates.
Equity Investment Risk
As of December 31, 2022, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies
was $7.2 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian,
represent $5.0 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market
price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments
in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more
complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional
uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” for additional
information.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Amazon.com, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as
the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
34
Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of
the Matter
As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income
taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are
many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment
is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The
Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more
likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $4.0 billion for various tax
contingencies.
Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because
the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the
benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management’s
evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted
by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity.
How We
Addressed the
Matter in Our
Audit
We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies,
including controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained;
the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the
development of the related disclosures.
We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in
assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the
specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our
procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s
correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions
are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income
tax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax
contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential
effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the
appropriateness of the Company’s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data
used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We evaluated the Company’s income tax
disclosures in relation to these matters.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES
Description of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets,
consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers
through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to
grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors,
independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell
content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology
services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and
sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through
programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 —
Segment Information.”
Common Stock Split
On May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of
authorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout
this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a
par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split
was reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.”
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other operating
expense (income), net” was reclassified into “Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized content
costs, operating lease assets, and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities
(collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable
interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our
seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives
of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation
forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and
operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video
content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing
basis, and effective January 1, 2022 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from four years to five years and
for our networking equipment from five years to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our
hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022, based
on servers and networking equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2021 and those
acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $3.6 billion
and a benefit to net loss of $2.8 billion, or $0.28 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $1.1 billion, of which $720 million was recorded in
the fourth quarter, of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These
charges were recorded in “Other operating expense (income), net” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily
impacted our North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded expenses of approximately
41
$480 million primarily in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations relating to terminating contracts for certain
leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $720 million, of which $640 million was recorded in
the fourth quarter, of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded
primarily in “Technology and content,” “Fulfillment,” and “General and administrative” on our consolidated statements of
operations and primarily impacted our North America segment.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share
is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as
determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our
calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.
The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2021 2022
Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 10,005 10,117 10,189

Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 10,198 10,296 10,189
Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return
allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties,
including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is
allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone
selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:
Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of
the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an
Amazon delivery, to the customer.
Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders
through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees
we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the
related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.
42
Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to
content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime
memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation.
Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized
over the subscription period.
Advertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through
programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the
number of clicks or impressions.
AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is
allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based
on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including
compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales
commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.
Other - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video
content and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or
distributed and as or when services are performed.
Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for
return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $859 million, $1.0 billion, and $1.3 billion as of
December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Additions to the allowance were $3.5 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions
from the allowance were $3.6 billion, $4.9 billion, and $5.2 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Included in “Inventories” on our
consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $852 million, $882 million, and $948 million as of December 31, 2020, 2021,
and 2022, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs,
including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media
content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers
are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and
related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated
statements of operations.
Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions,
incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we
pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost
of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We
evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates
can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.
Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International
segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such
as depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories;
picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including
costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain
management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us
in fulfillment and customer service operations.
43
Technology and Content
Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and
development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and
display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include
servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses
necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to
offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy
innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service
and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and
selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer
referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third
parties.
Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $10.9
billion, $16.9 billion, and $20.6 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related
expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant
and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares
granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of
estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires
judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded
as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures,
including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes
stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the
end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and, for 2020, a benefit
from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor partially offset by a lease impairment and, for 2022, $1.1
billion of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,

44
Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 and 2022 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $11.8
billion and $(12.7) billion from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s
preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s
initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As
of December 31, 2022, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 17%
ownership interest, and an approximate 16% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant
influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, and one
of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment
in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and
losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We
intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely
outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such
amounts.
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates
expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are
evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We
consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative
loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods
available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.
We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first
step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely
than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step
is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require
periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our
tax contingencies in income tax expense.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the
following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
45
Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted
prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities
in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably
available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of
securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from
or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3
assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.
We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022,
these warrants had a fair value of $3.4 billion and $2.1 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated
balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.
These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and
are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently
available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product
vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance,
representing a write-down of inventory, was $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.
We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers
maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and
therefore these products are not included in our inventories.
We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to
provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead
times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain
electronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These
commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We
also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.
Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to
customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, customer receivables, net, were $20.2 billion and $26.6
billion, vendor receivables, net, were $5.3 billion and $6.9 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion.
Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers
primarily to procure inventory.
We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses.
Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected
in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.4
billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Additions to the allowance were $1.4 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.6 billion,
and deductions to the allowance were $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.3 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022.
Software Development Costs
We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use
software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs,
including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.
46
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from
property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own,
along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the
construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment,
heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, four years
prior to January 1, 2022 and five years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our servers, five years prior to January 1, 2022 and six
years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for
other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense
categories on our consolidated statements of operations.
Leases
We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are
generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired
under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our
leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.
Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of
property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are
accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone
prices.
Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a
discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present
value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease
prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and
amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.
When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase
the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the
classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes
in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.
Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the
term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term.
The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method
over the lease term.
We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the
termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded
liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.
Financing Obligations
We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have
control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the
arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful
life or the term of the obligation.
If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are
derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event
occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative
assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset
is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and
indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value,
we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash
47
flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily
on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.
We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible
assets as of April 1, 2022, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their
carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions,
Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.”
Other Assets
Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content,
net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization;
equity warrant assets and certain equity investments; and satellite network launch services deposits. We recognize certain
transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or
certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as
reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.
Digital Video and Music Content
We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing
agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the
license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we
recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we
amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line
basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are
expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to
“Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content.
The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years. We review usage and viewing patterns
impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. Changes in
historical and anticipated viewing patterns are lengthening the weighted average life of our capitalized video content. We
anticipate the changes in viewing patterns will positively impact 2023 operating income by approximately $1.0 billion,
generally ratably throughout the year.
Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each
major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an
event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of
video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were $10.7 billion and $16.7 billion.
Total video and music expense was $13.0 billion and $16.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. Total video
and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships,
and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.
Investments
We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term
fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Marketable fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in
fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a
forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our
consolidated statements of operations.
Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are
accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on
our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements
of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our
assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other
publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2021 and
2022, these investments had a carrying value of $603 million and $715 million.
Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value
option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method
48
investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as
reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are
recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting
period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the
investment to its estimated fair value.
Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair
value option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with
changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that
would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a
significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying
amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss
based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale
when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for
sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at
the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.
Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and
asset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, current debt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, selfinsurance liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.4 billion and $7.7 billion and our
liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by
a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.
Self-Insurance Liabilities
Although we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively selfinsure for exposure primarily related to workers’ compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability,
and automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate selfinsurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development,
inflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement
amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. As of
December 31, 2021 and 2022, our total self-insurance liabilities were $2.2 billion and $4.0 billion and are included in “Accrued
expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general,
product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and
unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted
our North America segment.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is
recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime
memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $14.0 billion, of which $11.3 billion was recognized as
revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $16.1 billion.
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion of unearned
revenue as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.
Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer
contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that
exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $110.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average
remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.7 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven
by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.

Other Long-Term Liabilities
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing
obligations, asset retirement obligations, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax
liabilities.
Foreign Currency
We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly
incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that
either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our
consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we
recorded gains (losses) of $(118) million, $19 million, and $386 million in 2020, 2021, and 2022.
Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities

Note 5 — ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
2020 Acquisition Activity
During 2020, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, of
which $1.1 billion was capitalized to in-process research and development intangible assets (“IPR&D”).
2021 Acquisition Activity
During 2021, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $496 million, net of cash acquired.
2022 Acquisition Activity
On March 17, 2022, we acquired MGM Holdings Inc., for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash
acquired, to provide more digital media content options for customers. We also assumed $2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid
immediately after closing. The acquired assets primarily consist of $3.4 billion of video content and $4.9 billion of goodwill.
During 2022, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $141 million, net of cash
acquired.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the 2022 acquisitions, individually and in
the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred
and were not significant.
Goodwill
The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and
functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain
intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not
deductible for tax purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2021 and 2022 by segment (in millions):

(2) Finite-lived intangible assets, excluding acquired video content, have estimated useful lives of between one and twenty-five
years, and are being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basis.
(3) Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are in-process and used in research and development activities are
considered indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the research and development efforts. Once the research
and development efforts are completed, we determine the useful life and begin amortizing the assets.
Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangibles was $509 million, $512 million, and $604 million in 2020,
2021, and 2022. Expected future amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 is as

___________________
(1) The weighted-average remaining lives of the 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, April 2022, and December 2022 Notes were 12.6,
14.2, 16.7, 13.3, 13.3, and 5.9 years as of December 31, 2022. The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes
was 13.1 years as of December 31, 2022.
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to
time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair
value of the Notes was approximately $53.3 billion and $61.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which is based on
quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.
We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which
we increased from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in August 2022 and we may from time to time increase in the future subject to
lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily
Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were
$803 million and $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which
had an interest rate of 1.5% and 5.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we have pledged $918 million and
$1.2 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the
Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2023 $ 3,000

$ 70,542
We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may
from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of
issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In March 2022, we
increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $10.0 billion to $20.0 billion. There were $725 million and $6.8
billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which were
56
included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest
rate, including issuance costs, of 0.08% and 4.47%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial
paper for general corporate purposes.
We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), which
was amended and restated in March 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion and to extend the
term to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate
applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit
Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.
In November 2022, we entered into a $10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders
(the “Short-Term Credit Agreement”), which matures in November 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364
days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of
0.05% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of
December 31, 2022.
We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $318 million and $1.2 billion of
borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which were included in “Accrued expenses
and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $6.9 billion of unused letters of credit as of December 31,
2022.
In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term
Loan”), which matures in January 2024 and bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan
plus 0.75%. If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan’s maturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase
from 0.75% to 1.05%. As of the date of this filing, the entire Term Loan is outstanding.

___________________
(1) Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment, sortation, and data center facilities. Excluding interest,
current financing obligations of $196 million and $266 million are recorded within “Accrued expenses and other” and $6.2
billion and $6.7 billion are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. The weightedaverage remaining term of the financing obligations was 18.8 years and 17.9 years and the weighted-average imputed
interest rate was 3.2% and 3.1% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.
(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content
that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.
For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any
minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely
at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is
specified.
(3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater
than one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with buildto-suit lease arrangements that are under construction.
(4) Excludes approximately $4.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate
of the amount and period of payment, if any.
In July 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) for approximately $3.9
billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. In August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire
iRobot Corporation for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to
fund these acquisitions with cash on hand.
Suppliers
During 2022, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or
arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit
limits.
Other Contingencies
We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added,
consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These
non-income tax controversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany
transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with
reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these
matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be
materially different from our expectations.

Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:
In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on
www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed
Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of
Embedded Objects Within a Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and
attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of
damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be
subject to $130 to $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California. In May 2022, the district court granted summary judgment holding that the patent is invalid. In
June 2022, Eolas filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously
in this matter.
In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com,
Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that
“Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface
Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages,
enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend
to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe
U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol”; and
7,233,978, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which
the Location Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’
fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. We dispute the allegations of
wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington, private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other
things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon’s stores,
monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for
the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the
District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases
include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s
stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek
billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees,
and costs. In March 2022 and January 2023, Amazon’s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in FrameWilson and De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (WD Wash), respectively; both courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon’s
pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are an unlawful
restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General’s lawsuit in its entirety; the
dismissal is under appeal as of January 2023. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in these matters.
In October 2020, BroadbandiTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and
Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among
other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and
10,536,751, each entitled “Video-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV
Services Subscribers”; 10,028,026, entitled “System for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform
of a Digital TV Services Provider”; and 9,973,825, entitled “Dynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based
on Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of
damages. In April 2022, BroadbandiTV alleged in its damages report that, in the event of a finding of liability, Amazon could
be subject to $166 to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment, holding that the
patents are invalid. In October 2022, BroadbandiTV filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will
continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating
to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections sought to impose
unspecified fines and remedial actions. In December 2022, the European Commission adopted formal commitments without
fines, fully resolving the investigation.
In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon
Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection
Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision
to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In November 2021, Jawbone Innovations, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services,
Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that
Amazon Echo smart speakers and displays, Fire TV Cube, and Echo Buds infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,246,058, entitled
“Detecting Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Using Both Acoustic and Nonacoustic Sensors”; 8,019,091, entitled “Voice Activity
Detector (VAD)-Based Multiple-Microphone Acoustic Noise Suppression”; 8,280,072, entitled “Microphone Array with Rear
Venting”; 8,321,213 and 8,326,611, both entitled “Acoustic Voice Activity Detection (AVAD) for Electronic Systems”;
8,467,543, entitled “Microphone and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Configurations for Use with Communications Systems”;
8,503,691, entitled “Virtual Microphone Arrays Using Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA)”; 10,779,080,
entitled “Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA)”; and 11,122,357, entitled “Forming Virtual Microphone Arrays
Using Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA).” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced
damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In November 2022, the case was transferred to the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in this matter.
In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à
r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming
that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial
actions and a fine of €1.13 billion, which we are paying and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. We believe
the ICA’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In July 2022, Acceleration Bay, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudFront, AWS
Lambda, Amazon Lumberyard, Luna, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, Amazon GameLift, GridMate, Amazon EKS, AWS App
Mesh, and Amazon VPC infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,701,344, entitled “Distributed Game Environment”; 6,714,966, entitled
“Information Delivery Service”; 6,732,147, entitled “Leaving a Broadcast Channel”; 6,829,634, entitled “Broadcasting
Network”; and 6,910,069, entitled “Joining a Broadcast Channel.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount
of damages, enhanced damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to
defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In November 2022, LightGuide, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Nike
Intent Detection System used in certain fulfillment centers infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,515,981, entitled “Light Guided
Assembly System”; and 9,658,614 and 10,528,036, each entitled “Light Guided Assembly System and Method.” The complaint
seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute
the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory
proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust,
privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,
and other matters.
The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant
uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular
basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including
amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our
accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or
range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of
losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if
any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the
amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

Note 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Preferred Stock
We have authorized 500 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. No preferred stock was outstanding for any
year presented.
Common Stock
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.4 billion, 10.5 billion, and 10.6
billion, as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding,
including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.
Stock Repurchase Activity
In March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with
no fixed expiration, which replaced the previous $5.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of
Directors in February 2016. We repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for $6.0 billion in 2022 under these
programs. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2020 or 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have $6.1 billion
remaining under the repurchase program.
Stock Award Plans
Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years.

As of December 31, 2022, there was $23.8 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based
compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with more than half of the compensation
expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a remaining weighted-average recognition period of 1.1 years. The
estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 was 26.7%, 26.5%, and 26.5%. Changes in our estimates and
assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future.
During 2020, 2021, and 2022, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $15.5 billion, $18.2 billion, and
$12.8 billion.
Common Stock Available for Future Issuance
As of December 31, 2022, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 1.7 billion shares.
Note 9 — INCOME TAXES
In 2020, 2021, and 2022, we recorded net tax provision (benefit) of $2.9 billion, $4.8 billion, and $(3.2) billion. Our U.S.
taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and
development expenses. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $1.7 billion, $3.7 billion, and $6.0 billion for 2020, 2021, and
2022.
Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those
earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by
allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision
included a partial election for 2020 and 2021, and a full election for 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development
expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes.

___________________
(1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits or shortfalls from stock-based compensation.
Our tax provision includes $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2020 and
2021, and a $33 million tax shortfall from stock-based compensation for 2022.
(2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is
referred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction.
Our provision for income taxes in 2021 was higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was
partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal research and development credits and the impact of the distribution of certain
intangible assets from Luxembourg to the U.S. in Q4 2021, resulting in the utilization of $2.6 billion of Luxembourg deferred
tax assets previously subject to a valuation allowance.
We generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a
decrease in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction. This was partially offset by a reduction in excess
tax benefits from stock-based compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline
in the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions. The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022
reflects a change in our application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes an
income tax benefit of approximately $655 million related to years prior to 2022.
We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,
indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of
such amounts.

(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.
(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign
taxing jurisdictions or future capital gains, as well as tax credits.
Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net
operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as
of December 31, 2022 were approximately $10.4 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual
limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2023.
Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are
established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The
provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.

The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions):

Gross tax contingencies – December 31 (1) $ 2,820 $ 3,242 $ 4,002
 ___________________
(1) As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $4.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $2.2 billion, if fully
recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to
tax contingencies of $110 million and $103 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 were $(48) million, $28 million, and $(7) million.
We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016
and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net
operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.
We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India,
Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional
assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are
currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of
income.
In September 2022, the Luxembourg Tax Authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we
distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA’s position is without merit and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In February 2023, we received a decision by the Indian Tax Authority (“ITA”) that tax applies to cloud services fees paid
to the U.S. We will need to remit taxes on the services in question, including for a portion of prior years, until this matter is
resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA’s decision is without merit, we intend to
defend our position vigorously, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we would reflect
significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.
In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax
authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European
Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax
authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European
Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006
through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to
recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we
deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg
appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General
Court annulled the European Commission’s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to
the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax
contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and
regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the
amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts
accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax
authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or
settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any
change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an
estimate of the range of possible outcomes.

Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment
results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and
administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of
technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining noninfrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal
revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker
evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations.
North America
The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from
these online stores.
International
The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these
internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and
Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.
AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for
start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision
and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2022.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31,
2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting and its report is included below.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements
due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Amazon.com, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
