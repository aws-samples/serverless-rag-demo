The most distinguishing feature of virosterco is its ability to induce a temporary lowering of body temperature, leading to chills and a sensation of coldness even in warm environments. This phenomenon occurs due to the virus's impact on the body's thermoregulation mechanisms. In addition to the typical cold symptoms, affected children may experience shivering and increased sensitivity to cooler temperatures.
